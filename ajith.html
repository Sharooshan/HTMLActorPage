  After a six-year sabbatical, Ajith signed up for his third season of car racing by participating in the 2010 season of
  the FIA Formula Two Championship.[96] The decision to be involved in the sport was made after Ajith's film directed by
  Gautham Vasudev Menon was delayed, allowing him to participate in the whole season.[97] Prior to signing up, he
  competed in the final round of the MRF racing series in Chennai in February 2010, but failed to finish the race due to
  mechanical problems. Further trials in Sepang, Malaysia followed suit as he practised for the season's beginning in
  April 2010 in his Formula Renault V6 car with Eurasian Racing, shedding 11 kilograms during training.[98]
